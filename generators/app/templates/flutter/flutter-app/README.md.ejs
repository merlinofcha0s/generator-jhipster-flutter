This application was generated using JHipster Flutter generator, you can find documentation at [https://github.com/merlinofcha0s/generator-jhipster-flutter](https://github.com/merlinofcha0s/generator-jhipster-flutter).

## Prerequisite

- [flutter-intl](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13666-flutter-intl) IDE plugins for I18n if you use Android Studio or IntelliJ

## Development

Building the project:

1. Getting dependencies (You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [pubspec.yaml](pubspec.yaml)) : 

        flutter pub get
        
2. Running reflection (You will only need to run this command when you change DTOs or models) : 

        flutter pub run build_runner build
        
3. Start the project (You can also start it with your IDE) :

        flutter run
        
4. Generate I18n in case you're **NOT** using Android studio or IntelliJ (Run it everytime you change something in the [lib/l10n](lib/l10n) folder):
        
        flutter pub global run intl_utils:generate
